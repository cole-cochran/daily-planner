## Boostrap
The daily planner began by figuring out how to handle the columns in Boostrap to functionally create HTML that reflects the mockup. Adjusting the col-sm and col-lg values to reflect the correct sizing of the text areas, save button, and the row for the time block. After completing the proper sizing for hours 9-5 using the class of time-block I adjusted the CSS to match the starter code classes, as well as my own.
